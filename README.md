# GreeJS

https://powerful-crag-47059.herokuapp.com/

## Getting Started
Developers will have to include the `gree.css` and `gree.js` files that have been downloaded. `jquery.js` must also be included as a dependency. For example:
```{=html}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	...
	<link href="styles/gree.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
<body>
	...   
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script src="scripts/gree.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
